- **`newpwd.php`**: Saves the newly confirmed password and redirects to the login page.

### Booking

- **`booking.php`**: Processes booking requests, validating input and saving to the database if the booking time is at least 1 hour in the future. A confirmation email is sent to the user.

### Administration

- **`admin.php`**: Provides admin login and dashboard for managing the system, including viewing and assigning unbooked requests.

### Logout

- **`logout.php`**: Clears the session and redirects to the login page, ensuring user data privacy.
